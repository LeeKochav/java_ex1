In this project we present implematation of mathematical functions ,mathematical operation between functions,saving them to a file and displaying them in a graphical window
Implemented classes: polynom, monom, complex functiona and function_gui.

In mathematics, a polynom is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients and  monom is a polynom which has only one term. 
Complex function is a combination of functions and operations.

## Class Monom
This class represent a simple monom of shape ax^b where a is a real number and b is an integer. 
 
## Class Polynom
This class represent a simple polynom of shape a1x^b1+a2x^b2â€¦.
The polynom class represent as an arraylist of monoms.

## Class ComplexFunction
This class represent a complex function type y=g(f1(x),f2(x)), where both f1,f2 are functions. y and x are real numbers and g is an operation: plus,mul,div,max,min,comp(f1(f2(x))).


## Class Function_GuI
This class represents a collection of mathematical functions which can be presented on a GUI window and can be saved (and load) to file. 

## Relevant files for testing 
-	file.txt
